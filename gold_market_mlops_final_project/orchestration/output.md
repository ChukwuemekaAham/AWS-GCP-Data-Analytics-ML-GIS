# Feature Importance Breakdown:
- feature_0_importance: 0.16807282700190107 - This corresponds to the feature "Open" (the opening price of gold). It has the lowest importance score, meaning it's the least influential feature in your model.

- feature_1_importance: 0.36136955899717427 - This corresponds to the feature "High" (the highest price of gold during the day). It has a moderate importance score, indicating it's a moderately influential feature.

- feature_2_importance: 0.4705576140009248 - This corresponds to the feature "Low" (the lowest price of gold during the day). It has the highest importance score, making it the most influential feature in your model.


# Insights:
- "Low" is Key: Your model suggests that the "Low" price of gold during the day is the most important predictor of the 

- "Close" price (your target variable). This is an interesting finding that could be further investigated.

- "High" is Also Important: The "High" price has moderate influence, indicating it's also a valuable predictor.

- "Open" is Least Important: The "Open" price has the least impact on the prediction, suggesting that it might be less relevant in your model.
