## Communicating Spatial Data Science Findings: A StoryMap about SNAP Participation Trends

Creating an engaging ArcGIS StoryMap, helps to effectively communicate spatial analysis findings to a specific audience. 

This project guides me through creating an ArcGIS StoryMap to effectively communicate the results of a spatial analysis focused on SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) participation trends. I combined previously completed hot spot, outlier, and space-time analyses into a visually engaging and informative StoryMap. 

**Scenario:**

You are tasked with creating a compelling story to communicate the findings of a study on SNAP participation patterns across the contiguous United States. Your analysis included hot spot and outlier analysis for 2019 and a space-time pattern mining investigation of trends from 2010 to 2019.  Your audience is decision-makers who need to understand the spatial patterns and changes in SNAP participation to effectively distribute resources and ensure food security. 

### How I approach this challenge

**1. Identify Your Audience:**

* **Answered the following questions to define the audience and story objectives:**
    * Who are you explaining this analysis to? (Analyst, decision-maker, general public)
    * What do you want the audience to do with the information? (Make a decision, share the story, critique the analysis)
    * What is the problem that your analysis is trying to resolve?
    * Which analysis is the focus of your story (pattern detection, space-time pattern mining, or both)?
    * What are the most important aspects of this analysis? 

**Outcome:** By clearly identifying your audience and objectives, you establish the framework for your story. This ensures the content is tailored and relevant to the intended users.

**2. Create Your Content Inventory:**

* **Prepared the ArcGIS Online content for the StoryMap:**
    * Open a new private or incognito web browser window.
    * Go to the Spatial Data Science MOOC group page in ArcGIS Online: [https://www.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=2eb4affd53384172a5d0a25ac057d386#overview](https://www.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=2eb4affd53384172a5d0a25ac057d386#overview).
    * Find the `Pattern Detection` web map owned by `EsriTrainingSvc`.
    * Open the map in Map Viewer. 
    * Sign in to ArcGIS Online with your provided course account.
    * Save a copy of the map by clicking the `Save And Open` button and choosing `Save As`.  Name it "Pattern Detection \[your initials] \[today's date]". 
    * Repeat this process for the `Space_Time Pattern Mining 2D` map and the `Space_Time Pattern Mining 3D` scene. 

**Outcome:** You have saved copies of the maps and scene, which will be the core visual elements of your story.

**3. Create an Outline:**

* **Structured the StoryMap:**
    * Create an outline for your story, including:
        * The problem your analysis is trying to resolve.
        * An introduction to the analysis.
        * An explanation of the analysis methodology (hot spot analysis, outlier analysis, space-time pattern mining).
        * An explanation of the analysis results.
        * The answer to the problem you were trying to resolve.
        * A clear definition of next steps.
        * Additional resources that the reader can explore.

**Outcome:** You have a structured outline to guide you in building your StoryMap, ensuring a logical flow and completeness of information.

**4. Add Media to Your Content Inventory:**

* **Find and gathered images for the StoryMap:**
    * While finding images, consider:
        * Permission to use the image (crediting if necessary)
        * Publicly shared status
        * Relevance to your story's takeaways
        * Image size and suitability for display
* Note the URL or location of each image and any necessary credits.

**Outcome:** You have gathered visual resources that will enhance your story, making it more engaging and impactful.

**5. Prepare Maps and Scenes:**

* **Refined the maps and scenes:**
    * Open the `Pattern Detection` web map in Map Viewer.
    * Review the layers: `US_Counties`, `SNAPHotSpots`, and `SNAPOutliers`.
    * **[Rename the layers for clarity.]**
    * **[Adjust the symbology, pop-ups, and other settings for the maps and scenes as needed. ]**
    * **[Consider using tile layers for overall trends and feature layers for interactive elements.]**
    * **[Remove any unnecessary layers.]**
    * Save the map. 
    * Repeat the process for the `Space_Time Pattern Mining 2D` map and the `Space_Time Pattern Mining 3D` scene.

**Outcome:** You have optimized the visual elements of your StoryMap, improving clarity and user experience.

**6. Create a New Story:**

* **Build the StoryMap:**
    * Open a new private or incognito web browser window and go to [https://storymaps.arcgis.com](https://storymaps.arcgis.com).
    * Sign in with your ArcGIS Online account.
    * Click `New Story` and choose `Start From Scratch`.
    * Add a title to your story. 
    * Add a byline with your name.

**Outcome:** You have started creating a new StoryMap, ready to add content.

**7. Add Story Elements:**

* **Used the outline as a guide:**
    * Add text, media, and immersive blocks to your story.
    * **[Add the maps and scenes you prepared.]**

**Outcome:** You have added text, images, maps, and scenes to your StoryMap, creating a well-structured narrative.

**8. Choose a Story Design:**

* **Customized the StoryMap:**
    * On the `Design` tab of the StoryMap builder, select a cover and theme that match the tone of your story and visuals.
    * Preview your story and make any necessary changes.

**Outcome:** You have selected a visually appealing design for your StoryMap.

**9. Publish a Story for Sharing:**

* **Shared the StoryMap:**
    * On the `Publish` tab, choose `Everyone (Public)` for the sharing settings. 
    * Click `Publish`.

**Outcome:** Your StoryMap has been published and is now publicly accessible.

* **[Copy the StoryMap's URL.]** 

**10. Share Your Story:**

* **[Post the URL on the Lesson Forum with the hashtag #section6.]** 
* **[Explore other MOOC participant stories for inspiration.]** 

**Outcome:** You have shared your completed StoryMap with other MOOC participants.
