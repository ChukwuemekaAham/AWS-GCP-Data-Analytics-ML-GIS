## Exploring Spatial Patterns in SNAP Participation Rates Using ArcGIS Pro

This project uses ArcGIS Pro's optimized statistical cluster analysis tools to identify meaningful patterns of high and low SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) participation rates in the contiguous United States.  This information can aid decision-makers in distributing resources more effectively and equitably, ensuring healthy food accessibility for all SNAP recipients.

**Scenario:**

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a federal program in the United States that helps families buy nutritional food to maintain their health and well-being.  By analyzing spatial patterns in SNAP participation, we can better understand areas with high and low participation rates, informing strategies to improve food security.

**2. Open an ArcGIS Pro Project:**

* Start ArcGIS Pro.
* On the Start page, click Open Another Project. 
* In the Open Project dialog box, browse to the `PatternDetection_SpaceTime` folder that you saved on your computer.
* Click `PatternDetection_SpaceTime.aprx` to select it, and then click OK.

Using a hot spot analysis and an outlier analysis, I located statistically significant clusters of
both high and low SNAP participation. This information can help in the allocation of SNAP
resources to areas of higher food insecurities and also help identify areas where eligible residents
may be underutilizing or not enrolling in the SNAP program. The results can help drive the
decision to distribute resources more efficiently and equitably.
