Course description

In this course, I learned to build batch data analytics solutions using Amazon EMR, an enterprise-grade Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop managed service. I understood how Amazon EMR integrates with open-source projects such as Apache Hive, Hue, and HBase, and with AWS services such as AWS Glue and AWS Lake Formation. The course addressed data collection, ingestion, cataloging, storage, and processing components in the context of Spark and Hadoop. I learned to use EMR Notebooks to support both analytics and machine learning workloads. Additionally, I learned how to apply security, performance, and cost management best practices to the operation of Amazon EMR.
