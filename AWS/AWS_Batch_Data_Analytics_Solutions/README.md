Course description

In this course, I learnt to build batch data analytics solutions using Amazon EMR, an enterprise-grade Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop managed service. Understood how Amazon EMR integrates with open-source projects such as Apache Hive, Hue, and HBase, and with AWS services such as AWS Glue and AWS Lake Formation. The course addresses data collection, ingestion, cataloging, storage, and processing components in the context of Spark and Hadoop. Learnt to use EMR Notebooks to support both analytics and machine learning workloads. Learnt how to apply security, performance, and cost management best practices to the operation of Amazon EMR.
