# Overview: Dat as a product
You are a data engineer in a Company. Your company is developing a new application that uses movie data. As part of the application development process, you were asked to set up permissions for two different types of customers: standard subscription and enterprise subscription. You set up these permissions using AWS Lake Formation tags (LF-tags) and then confirm if you grant the right access using Lake Formation tag-based access control (LF-TBAC) permissions. 

## Objectives 
• View an AWS Glue job that maintains a dataset. 
• Define LF-tags and apply them to resources. 
• Grant LF-TBAC permissions to data consumers. 
• Verify consumer-specific data views using Athena. 

Here I view an AWS Glue job that maintains a processed dataset. Configure access to support data discovery using LF-tags and then set up custom access for two different consumers. Used Amazon Athena to access the curated data product.
