## Flood Mapping with Sentinel-1 Data: A Step-by-Step Guide

This guide outlines the steps involved in flood mapping using Sentinel-1 data, specifically focused on the Borno region.

**1. Data Acquisition and Pre-Processing:**

* **Download Sentinel-1 Data:** Obtain Sentinel-1 data (SAR images) from the [Copernicus Open Access Hub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/). Select images covering the Borno region and dates relevant to your flood event.
* **Data Format:** Sentinel-1 data is usually provided in a compressed .SAFE format (Sentinel Application Platform - European Space Agency).
* **Pre-Processing:** Perform these initial steps to prepare the SAR images:
    * **Calibration:** Convert raw signals to backscatter values.
    * **Ornithoin Correction:** Correct for terrain slope and topography effects.
    * **Speckle Filtering:** Reduce noise and speckle (grainy appearance) in the images.

**2. Flood Detection Techniques:**

* **Change Detection:**
    * **Compare Images:**  Compare two SAR images: pre-flood and post-flood. Areas with significant backscatter changes indicate flooded areas.
    * **Tools:** Use SNAP (Sentinel Application Platform) or GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) for image differencing and thresholding.
* **Water Index Algorithms:**
    * **Calculate NDWI:** Use the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) algorithm to highlight water bodies based on SAR polarization properties.
    * **Tools:** SNAP (Sentinel Application Platform) provides tools for NDWI calculation.
* **Machine Learning:**
    * **Train a Model:** Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) using labeled data (flooded/non-flooded) from SAR images.
    * **Tools:** Utilize libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for model training.

**3. Post-Processing and Visualization:**

* **Georeferencing:** Ensure accurate georeferencing of the flood maps to geographic coordinates.
* **Visualization:** Display the flood maps using a GIS software like QGIS or ArcGIS.
* **Validation:** Compare your maps with ground truth data (e.g., aerial photos, field observations) to assess accuracy.

**Example Workflow with SNAP:**

1. **Import Images:** Load your Sentinel-1 images into SNAP.
2. **Pre-process:** Apply calibration, orthorectification, and speckle filtering.
3. **Change Detection:**
    * **Subtract Images:** Subtract the pre-flood image from the post-flood image.
    * **Threshold:** Apply a threshold to identify areas with significant backscatter changes.
4. **Water Index:**
    * **Calculate NDWI:** Generate a water index map using the NDWI algorithm in SNAP.
    * **Threshold:** Set a threshold to identify water bodies.
5. **Georeference:** Ensure the map is accurately georeferenced.
6. **Export:** Export the flood map in a suitable format (e.g., GeoTIFF) for visualization.
7. **Visualize:**  Open the flood map in QGIS or ArcGIS for display.

**Key Points:**

* **Data Availability:** Sentinel-1 data is freely available.
* **SAR Expertise:**  Specialized SAR image processing knowledge and tools are required.
* **Validation:**  Compare your results with ground truth data to verify accuracy.
